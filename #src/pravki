1. HOMEPAGE: On the business image scroller, the words UK GROUP etc gets cut off when it comes into view. See attached.


2. Can you change the year on the footer to 2021. I can’t do this.

3. FOOTER:. They want to remove all details. I’ve done everything on the left but it looks a little odd. So can we make the logo a little bigger please, then remove everything from the righthand side too – yes, all the newsletter signup details please. The end result will be a slightly larger Amcomri logo on the left and nothing else in the footer.

4. INDIVIDUAL BLOG POSTS: Can you make it so the Amcomri logo icon is facing upwards, rather than to the right. I assume this is a global element? But essentially it needs to be facing up on all blog posts.

5. CONTACT INFO: I’ve had to add just their contact details. But I can’t seem to get it so the names are evenly spaced. Can you work your magic to do this. You can see there’s a bigger gap between Ben and Mark details at the moment.


6. LEADERSHIP: I need to be able to add in their email addresses under each person. When I do this it just adds it to the end of the copy, and I can’t make it a hyperlink.
